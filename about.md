I am a consultant Cloud Native Platform Engineer and programmer. I spend most of my spare time contributing 
to projects like [OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com), [K3sup](https://k3sup.dev) and [Inlets](https://inlets.dev).

### More Information

I left my full time job at the end of 2019 to start my own business advising companies on Digital Transformation, 
DevOps and Cloud Native architecture. 

If your team has "a fear of deploying on a friday" or is struggling with utilising the power of public cloud then I 
would love to have a chat about how you can start to move in a new direction.


My main focus areas are:
* Infrastructure as Code
* Cloud Native architecture
* Creating a DevOps Culture
* Public Cloud
* Serverless
