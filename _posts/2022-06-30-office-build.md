# Building my home office

This wasn't my first DIY project. Let's not pretend that I suddenly knew how to build this without several years of increasingly
more complex projects.

It all started when we moved house in August 2020. After 9 months waiting to move in (and therefore not doing any work on the 
house we were selling) we needed to "redecorate" our new house. This involved laying some new wooden flooring, painting and 
re-finishing a fireplace. These are fairly simple tasks for a "keen DIYer" and I have no doubt that anyone reading this 
could have a good go at these and be happy with the results.

Things got increasingly more complex from there. First it was building a window seat:

This really opened my eyes to how even more complex projects were within my skill level.

In the following months I re-built our fish pond (bricklaying) and totally refitted our bathroom. Took everything out, including the 
flooring, walls, shower and then re-fitted everything.

## The Office

I was already very privileged to have a dedicated room inside the house we purpose fitted to be my office.

However, I like to have a project on the go!

# Getting started

Pick a spot large enough to house your building! 

I'm based in the UK and the rules around garden buildings are complicated. Make sure you know what permits/permissions you need
before you start to avoid having to tear down your new building!

## Power
I decided to build the office at the bottom of the garden. I got my electrician to run a large armoured cable from the fuse-board
in the house down to the garden 

 > Make sure to get a professional to install any electrical cables, they need to be rated for outdoors and you may need
 > to have your house electrics upgraded to be safe too!
 
Once the electrician had connected the cable to the house (and terminated it at the end of the garden in an outdoor socket 
so I could easily get power while doing the work) the cable needed burying!

The UK requires that external cables that are buried are at least 600mm deep and have a yellow warning tape on top with a final layer of 
gravel to make extra sure soneone won't accidentally dig into the cable! Here's a pictire.

I had to run the cable about 20m from the end of that building (in the photo) to the spot where the office was. THIS TOOK AGES!

Digging is hard, it probably took 2 full days digging this by hand. I couldn't get any machines into the garden because I only have access
to the back through a single doorway in the garage.

> TIP: If you can hire a trench digging machine DO! Unless your distance is short it wills ave you A LOT of time.
