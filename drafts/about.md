down to specific vendors, integrations and ways of working.

All the flexibility and configurability that comes with utilising the cloud, and cloud native patterns come at a cost.

organisations have a tenancy to mimic the communication structures of those organisations. If you look at your software

If your team has "a fear of deploying on a Friday" or is struggling with utilising the power of public cloud then I 
would love to have a chat about how you can start to move in a new direction.

My main focus areas are:
* Infrastructure as Code
* Cloud Native architecture
* Creating a DevOps Culture
* Public Cloud
* Serverless
