### More Information

I left my full time job at the end of 2019 to start my own business advising companies on Digital Transformation, 
DevOps and Cloud Native architecture.

My main focus areas are:
* Infrastructure as Code
* Cloud Native architecture
* Creating a DevOps Culture
* Public Cloud
* Serverless
